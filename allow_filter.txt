! Title: AdGuard DNS filter Allow List
! Description: List composed of several filters (AdGuard Base filter, Social Media filter, Tracking Protection filter, Mobile Ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy) and simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking
!
! This section contains the list of third-party advertising networks domains.
! Note, that we only put rules that block full domains here and not URL parts (there's `general_url.txt` for that). Also, it must be domains that are used in a third-party context.

! Good: ||doubleclick.net^$third-party
! Bad: /banner.jpg (should be in general_url.txt)
! Bad: ||adssubdomain.legitwebsite.com^ (should be in adservers_firstparty.txt)
